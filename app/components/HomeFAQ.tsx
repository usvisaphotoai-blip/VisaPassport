    q: "What are ICAO standards for a passport photo?",
    a: "ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) sets the global biometric standard used by passport and visa authorities worldwide — covering head size, eye position, neutral background, lighting, and expression.

    q: "Is there a free UK passport photo checker online?",

  },
  {
    q: "Can I print my passport photo on A4 paper at home?",
    a: "Yes. Once your photo passes validation, you can download a print-ready sheet with multiple copies of your passport photo arranged for standard A4 or Letter paper, ready to print at home or at any pharmacy or print shop.",
  },

    q: "What is the passport photo size for Sri Lanka?",
    a: "The Sri Lanka passport photo size follows the standard ICAO format of 45x35mm, with a plain white background and a neutral expression. Select Sri Lanka in our tool and we'll automatically crop and scale your photo to the correct size.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size photo do I need for a New Zealand visa?",
    a: "New Zealand visa photos generally follow the standard ICAO passport photo dimensions with a plain white or light-colored background. Choose New Zealand in our tool and we'll size, crop, and check your photo against the current requirements automatically.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the France visa photo size for 2026?",
    a: "France visa and Schengen visa photos require a 35x45mm size with a neutral, light-colored background, following the latest 2026 guidance. Our tool crops and validates your photo to this exact spec so it's accepted the first time.",

    q: "What size is a US passport photo?",

  },
  {
    q: "How do I crop a photo for a China visa application?",
    a: "Chinese visa photos require a specific size and background that differ slightly from standard ICAO rules. Our China visa photo editor automatically crops, resizes, and checks your photo against these requirements, so there's no manual guesswork.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are my photos safe? What about privacy?",
    a: "Absolutely. All original photos are automatically and permanently deleted after 24 hours. Download links expire after 1 hour. We are fully GDPR and CCPA compliant.",
